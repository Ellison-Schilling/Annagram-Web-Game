Description: This is a simple webpage game in which a user is prompted with a list of words and a jumble of letters with which to make the words. In order to win the user must type three words from the list that can be made using the letters provided in the jumble. There is no submit button as submits are done after each key press. If the user has typed a word from the list that can not be made with the letters then then a message will appear letting them know. If the user has typed a word not on the list or one already caught (in other words an invalid word) then a corresponding message will appear. If the user typed a correct word then if it is not the final one needed it will appear at the bottom with the others already found, else the user will be redirected to the success page. The game is built using AJAX, flask, Javascript, JQuery, and python.
